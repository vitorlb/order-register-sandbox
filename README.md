**RESTAURANT ORDER REGISTRATOR WITH DIRECT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PRODUCTION TEAM, KITCHEN, AND WAITERS**

**The Problem :**

At the restaurant where I work there are two floors and a backyard. Waiters have to take the orders from those places, and then carry them to the production area where the order is transmitted to the kitchen, and starts being produced ( bevereges cuttelary etc ). When the restaurant is crowded, waiters have to take for example 3 or more orders before transmitting them to the production area in a piece of paper, only then to be transmitted to the kitchen. 

**The challange :**

Create a React app where waiters, production and kitchen can be connected. This app haas an interface where waiters can easyly take up the food and drinks ordered, and a display that updates orders taken from waiters in real time for kitchen and production start taking care of the order right away. Cutting many steps in communication therefore creating more time.

**Features**

App was developed concerning an easy adaptation to diferent restaurants, any user can categorize the producs in diferent groups, and create table areas for easier organization.
